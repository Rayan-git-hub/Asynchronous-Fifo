# Asynchronous-Fifo
The provided Verilog code implements an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer with separate clocks for write and read operations (wr_clk and rd_clk). The FIFO operates with two primary features: the ability to store data asynchronously using distinct clock domains and the capacity to manage data flow with full and empty flags.
